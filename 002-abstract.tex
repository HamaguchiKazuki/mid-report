Voice conversion is a kind of voice changer and it is a method of converting the voice as if a specific person spoke. The previous method converts input speech to text once and outputs synthesized speech from the converted text. But this method has three problems. First, because using multiple tools, it is slow from input to output. Second, there are many misrecognition when converting voice to text. Third, when synthesized speech is output from converted text, conversion destination is limited. Therefore, in our group we try to improve these problems using deep neural network.
